### Data Preparation Essentials
To ensure smooth processing, follow these guidelines:

- Input files must include the `.mzML` extension in the feature quantification table and metadata table.
- **Metadata Table**:
  - Must include a column **filename**.
  - Can include attribute columns such as **replicates**, **sample type** (e.g., control, treatment), etc.
  - **Time**: A specific column for time is mandatory.

# Output Files

Upon processing your data, ChemProp2 generates an output in the form of a CSV file. 
This file is an enhanced version of the node-pair information, now including ChemProp2 scores for each pair. 
The scores range from -1 to +1, providing a comprehensive score for every edge (or node pair) within the molecular network.
         
Key aspects of the output CSV include:
- **Score Range**: Each node pair gets a score between -1 and +1.
- **Score Interpretation**: 
  - The magnitude of the score indicates the strength of the potential transformation. 
  - The sign of the score (positive or negative) reveals the directionality of the transformation. 
  - For example, in a node pair A & B, the sign of the score will indicate whether the transformation is from A to B or vice versa.

### Integration with Cytoscape
- You can download the results as a **zip file** containing the required **GraphML** and **style files** for Cytoscape visualization.
- To use the output in Cytoscape:
  1. Open the **GraphML** file in Cytoscape.
  2. Import the **style file**:
     - Navigate to **File > Import > Styles from File**.
     - Select and upload the `.xml` style file.
  3. Apply the imported style:
     - Go to the **Styles** panel in Cytoscape.  
     - By default, the style will be set to **default**.  
     - Use the drop-down menu to select the uploaded style (it may appear as **default_0** or another variation).  
     - The visualization will update based on the selected style.

üîç **How to Know If the App Is Running?**  
If you're performing a calculation or generating a figure and don't see any updates on the main page, 
check the **top-right corner** of the page. If you see the message **'RUNNING'**, the app is active and processing your request.  
            
üí° **All plots are interactive!**  
- Use your mouse to select areas and zoom in on specific regions.  
- Double-click on the plot to reset the zoom and return to the default view.  
- Save plots using the **camera icon** in the top-right corner of the plot. You can specify the image format (e.g., PNG) in the settings panel before saving.
